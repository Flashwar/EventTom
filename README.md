# Backend of EventTom

Backend for the **EventTom** project, an event management system created as part of a university Master program. This backend, built using Django, provides robust APIs for managing events, authentication, and database interactions.


## Getting started

Follow the steps below to set up the backend locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-eventtom.git
   cd backend-eventtom
   
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional): Create and activate a virtual environment for the project:**
    ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Requirements: Install the necessary Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Debugging
   
Start the Django Server: Run the development server:
   ```bash
      python manage.py runserver
   ```
The Server will then be available locally on http://127.0.0.1:8000
